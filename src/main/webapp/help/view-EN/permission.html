                    <p class="paragraph">The software provides two types of user permissions: one is User Role, the other is User Identity. User Role is used to specify permission at system level and it has two levels: Administrator and Staff, User Identity is used to specify permissions at project operation level and it has two levels: Project Manager and Project Member. Only after an User Role is assigned, you can be associated to one of User Identity.</p>
