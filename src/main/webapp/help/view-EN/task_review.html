                        <p class="paragraph">Depending on projectâ€™s type (Android and IOS), the automated test provide different test. In Android projects, it provides compatibility test (Monkey, SmartMonkey), automated script test (Appium, Robotium and Uiautomator) and traversal test; IOS projects provide compatibility test (Monkey) and automated script test (Appium). </p>
                        <p class="paragraph_mul">a) Project Manager (Project Member) logs in to the system and opens the project in "Project" page and click on the "Task" menu.</p>
                        <p class="paragraph_mul">b) In Task page, click "Create Task". There are three steps: entry the basic information, select the mobiles and submit the task. Refer to Section "Tasks" for details.</p>

                        <p class="paragraph">When the task is completed, the user can view the task information and result in Task page. See Section "Tasks" for details.</p>
                        <p class="paragraph">For the presentation and analysis of test reports, see sections "Report" and "Analyze Report".</p>
                        <p class="paragraph">Users can perform automated tests according to business processes. They can perform compatibility, automated script and traversal test, quickly and efficiently get test reports, and reduce management costs for mobiles and builds. Automated test allows users to perform multiple tests, locates problems, and fix problems in a timely manner, so it shortens the product release cycle.</p>
                        <p class="paragraph">The report provides users a comprehensive evaluation for App. For automated testing, the system provides IOS and Android environment. The IOS operating system provides compatibility testing and script testing. The Android operating system provides compatibility testing, script testing, and traversal testing. See Section "Tasks" for details.</p>

Startup is time that mobile install App; CPU refers to the test App occupies the CPU proportion of equipment; memory refers to the test App runtime occupied by the size of the mobile memory; Flow is app occupied of the upstream flow and downstream flow; power refers to loss of electricity value.</p>
